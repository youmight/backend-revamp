### Repository to practice and build up all minor components of backend dev, no frontend will be implemented
#### Task 1: Practice authentication
* Start with JWT. Since no database is present, we'll use a local array to store the users info. 
* Then a social media auth (not sure how that will work without a frontend on postman)
